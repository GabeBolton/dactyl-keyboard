## The Dactyl-ManuForm keyboard: Opposable Thumb Edition

This, the DMOTE, is a fork of the
[Dactyl-ManuForm](https://github.com/tshort/dactyl-keyboard), a parametrized,
split-hand, concave, columnar, ergonomic keyboard. In this fork, the thumb
cluster has been modified to minimize shearing forces.

Parameters have been moved out of the application code itself, into separate
files that are safe and easy to edit. Use them to change:

- Switch type: ALPS or MX.
- Size and shape.
    - Row and column curvature and tilt (tenting).
    - Exceptions at any level, down to the position of individual keys.
- Minor features like LED strips and wrist rests.

## The DMOTE Family

* Custom wrist rests: [veikman/dmote-topography](https://github.com/veikman/dmote-topography)

   Generates custom wrist rests with smooth organic topography. The topography is based on a bivariate normal distribution function multiplied by a logarithmic mound shape.

* A stabilizing accesory for the DMOTE: [veikman/dmote-beam](https://github.com/veikman/dmote-beam)

    Want even more tenting control? Hate it when your split keyboard gets out of line? Try the DMOTE Beam.

* Keycaps for ALPS or MX switches: [veikman/dmote-keycap](https://github.com/veikman/dmote-keycap)

    `dmote-keycap` produces a three-dimensional geometry for a keycap: Either a featureless maquette for use in easily rendered previews, or a keycap that you can print and use.
